A collection of classes to simulate traffic. 

The RoadItem class serves as the entry point into the organization where Dynamic (Vehicles and Traffic Lights) and Static (Stop/Yield signs and Intersections) are child classes.

The Road Class is a container for RoadItems and a collection of Roads are contained inside the Map class. 

Objects will be created and destroyed via the Simulator class that will interface with the GUI class to give user control over all of the objects on the map.
